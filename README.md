# HacthworkTechnicalTest
This is a public repo with a technical test for the company hatchwork, this show a simple app with 2 screens that gets information from another API, 


Hello everybody, I've been finished my application test, 
I need to specific something.

I used the new york times API, I send you to email, some of those important and secure information.

I honestly used XML instead jetpack compose because I have more experience in XML.

I prefer to use List view instead Recycler View, because its for me so easly to implement, as well the linear layout instead constraints layout (This just for test reasons).

I dont want to do my best effort in the view and ui, just did it, because I think if the client want to change everything to jetpack compose, I will do it later.

I prefer to focus all my attention into the separate of responsabillities, into DRY as well, and use so easly and correct the livedata and the observables, around the application.

And I had some issues with the test,but if you want to hear more please contact me  :)
